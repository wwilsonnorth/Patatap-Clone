# Patatap Clone
This project was built as part of Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course.

HTML, CSS & JavaScript used. This is a simplified clone of the famous visual sound kit application - Patatap. If you are unfamiliar with this, when you open the index.html file, all you need to do is press any of the letter keys on your keyboard and it will present to you a different colour circle and a unique sound with each press.

Download and run on your machine to try yourself!
